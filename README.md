<b>view demo: </b> <a href="https://agecount.netlify.app/">TEST</a>

this code shows my age (year and the tota of second) demo does not support custom date so to get you date you can fork this and change your date inside the date instance

```javascript

const brithYear = new Date("1999-06-08");

```

or you can add args to the function that calculate age and pass it through console in inspect element 
<i>myBirthDate</i> can be a string or a number this format <b>yyyy-mm-dd</b> is easy to read so follow it if you want

```javascript

setInterval((myBirthDate) => {
  const brithYear = new Date(myBirthDate);
}, interval);

```

i am bored so that's what i did in the near future when i take my shit srsly i'll be updating this repo to be an Edge extention with more custom feature or you can contribute do whatever you want
